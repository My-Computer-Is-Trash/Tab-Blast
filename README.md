# Tab Blast! (TBLST)
A stress test that opens a user-definable amount of tabs! Can your computer handle it? Probably not. However, it's still fun to watch!


# What I'm currently implimenting...
I am currently working on a new mode called extreme mode, this test will be harder on the graphics side of things. I am also completely revamping the GUI style....(again).
