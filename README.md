A stress test that opens a user-definable amount of tabs! Can your computer handle it? Probably not. However, it's still fun to watch!

I am completely revamping the GUI style....(again lol). Which includes a completely new color scheme, complex good looking button designs, and updates to website functionality: (Extreme Mode!)
